'''LOOP =>  

------>
Loops help us do the same things again and again. The same work can be done again and again.

Explain this from the concept of (till / until).

* Do any work again and again.
* But till when we will do this work? This is decided by until.
* Whatever condition we put inside until, till then the loop runs.
* Here, under the until condition.
* What is the work inside until?


====>>>  What is Loops?
In programming, loops are a sequence of instructions that does a specific set of instructions or tasks based on some conditions and continue the tasks until it reaches certain conditions.

====>>>  Types of loops in Python
Python provides three types of looping techniques:

====>>>  Loop Description
for Loop	This is traditionally used when programmers had a piece of code and wanted to repeat that ‘n’ number of times.
while Loop	The loop gets repeated until the specific Boolean condition is met.
Nested Loops	Programmers can use one loop inside another; i.e., they can use for loop inside while or vice – versa or for loop inside for loop or while inside while.
Primarily there are two types of loops in Python

==> While loop
==> For loop
We will look into this one by one!

==>> While loop
The syntax of a while loop looks like this:

    while condition:
    #Body of the loop 

The block keeps executing until the condition is true/false
In while loops, the condition is checked first. If it evaluates to true, the body of the loop is executed, otherwise not!

If the loop is entered, the process of condition check and execution is continued until the condition becomes false.

Quick Quiz: Write a program to print 1 to 50 using a while loop.

An Example:

i = 0
while i<5:
    print(“Sandeep”)
    i = i+1

(Above program will print Sandeep 5 times)

Note: if the condition never becomes false, the loop keeps getting executed.

Quick Quiz: Write a program to print the content of a list using while loops.

===>>>  For loop
A for loop is used to iterate through a sequence like a list, tuple, or string (iterables)

The syntax of a for loop looks like this:

l = [1, 7, 8]
for item in l:
	print(item)

(Above program will print 1, 7, and 8)

Range function in Python
The range function in python is used to generate a sequence of numbers.

We can also specify the start, stop, and step-size as follows:

            range(start, stop, step_size)

step size is usually not used with range()
An example demonstrating range() function

for i in range(0, 7):		#range(7) can also be used
	print(i)		#prints 0 to 6

For loop with else
An optional else can be used with a for loop if the code is to be executed when the loop exhausts.

Example:

l = [1, 7, 8]
for item in l:
	print(item)
else:
	print(“Done”)	#This is printed when the loop exhausts!

Output:

1

7

8

Done
Python Loop Control Statements
Control Statements	Description
Break statement	It is used to exit a while loop or a for a loop. It terminates the looping & transfers execution to the statement next to the loop.
Continue statement	It causes the looping to skip the rest part of its body & start re-testing its condition.
Pass statement	It is used in Python to when a statement is required syntactically, and the programmer does not want to execute any code block or command.
The break statement
‘break’ is used to come out of the loop when encountered. It instructs the program to – Exit the loop now.

Syntax:

===>>>>>>>>  Break statement using foe loop.....................................
Example:

for i in range(0, 80):
	print(i)	#This will print 0, 1, 2 and 3
	if i == 3:
		break
====>>>>    The continue statement..............................................

‘continue’ is used to stop the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next one. It instructs the program to “skip this iteration.”

Example:

for i in range(4):
	print(“printing”)
	if i == 2:	#if i is 2, the iteration is skipped
		continue
	print(i)


=====>>>   pass statement.........................................................
pass is a null statement in python. It instructs to “Do nothing.”

Example:

l = [1, 7, 8]
for item in l:
	pass		#without pass, the program will throw an error
